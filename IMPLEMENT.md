# AIDE Implementation Log

## Purpose

`IMPLEMENT.md` is the engineering execution log for repository changes. It records what changed, why it changed, how it was verified, which risks were avoided, and what remains unresolved. It is not a changelog.

## What To Record

- the work item or prompt id
- the changed paths
- the rationale for the change
- notable design decisions and policy choices
- tradeoffs accepted
- verification that was run
- regressions or scope errors explicitly avoided
- remaining issues, blockers, or deliberate deferrals

## Current Execution Log

## Work Item: P00

### Status

Completed

### Changed Paths

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `PLANS.md`
- `IMPLEMENT.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `governance/vision.md`
- `governance/support-policy.md`
- `governance/naming-policy.md`
- `governance/capability-levels.md`
- `governance/release-policy.md`

### Rationale

Replace the bootstrap placeholders with durable repository law for AIDE before any product features, host adapters, or scaffolding are introduced.

### Notable Design Decisions

- Defined AIDE as one project with one shared core and many host adapters.
- Centralized support posture in support tiers `T0` through `T5`.
- Centralized integration depth in capability levels `L0` through `L4`.
- Separated directory naming law from exact version coverage rules.
- Kept the phase release-gated so implementation work follows governance, inventory, and harness setup.

### Tradeoffs

- The documents favor durable policy over exhaustive examples.
- Future inventory and matrix details are referenced but intentionally not created in this prompt.

### Verification

- Verified file existence for all required deliverables:
  - `README.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `PLANS.md`
  - `IMPLEMENT.md`
  - `DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - `governance/vision.md`
  - `governance/support-policy.md`
  - `governance/naming-policy.md`
  - `governance/capability-levels.md`
  - `governance/release-policy.md`
- Ran `rg` checks across the deliverables for required conceptual anchors:
  - `AIDE`
  - `Automated Integrated Development Environment`
  - `one shared core`
  - `many host adapters`
  - `compatibility technology`
  - `version ranges`
  - `support tiers`
  - `capability levels`
  - `T0`
  - `T5`
  - `L0`
  - `L4`
- Verified the repository worktree shape with `git status --short`.

### Regressions Avoided

- No product code, adapter code, CI, packaging, or environment systems were introduced prematurely.
- No exact host version lists were embedded into source directory doctrine.
- No unsupported parity claims were added.

### Remaining Issues

None for P00. Product implementation, inventory, scaffolding, harness, environments, evals, and packaging remain intentionally deferred to later prompts.

## Work Item: P06

### Status

Completed

### Changed Paths

- `specs/README.md`
- `specs/architecture/**`
- `shared/README.md`
- `shared/core/README.md`
- `shared/protocol/README.md`
- `shared/transforms/README.md`
- `shared/diagnostics/README.md`
- `shared/config/README.md`
- `shared/schemas/**`
- `shared/cli/README.md`
- `shared/local-service/README.md`
- `PLANS.md`
- `IMPLEMENT.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION.md`

### Rationale

The repository already had governance, inventory, matrices, host-lane scaffolds, and host-family research. It did not yet have the contract architecture that explains how one shared core and many host adapters should actually fit together. P06 fills that gap before implementation begins.

### Notable Design Decisions

- Defined AIDE as a transport-agnostic shared core with thin host adapters.
- Standardized three execution modes: `embedded`, `cli-bridge`, and `local-service`.
- Defined stable contract objects for host identity, host context, document context, workspace context, selection context, feature requests, settings, diagnostics, capability reports, and adapter responses.
- Explicitly separated shared logic from host UI, packaging, runtime glue, and host-only policy exceptions.
- Kept schemas conservative and descriptive rather than over-engineering them into full validation systems before implementation pressure exists.

### Tradeoffs

- The architecture is intentionally structural and leaves several implementation details open, including concrete protocol serialization, service lifecycle mechanics, and feature-manifest file placement.
- The schemas stabilize core shape now, but they do not attempt exhaustive validation of every future edge case.

### Verification

- Verified existence of required `specs/architecture/` files, shared subtree directories, shared subtree `README.md` files, and schema files.
- Ran `rg` checks for required architecture anchors including:
  - `one shared core`
  - `many host adapters`
  - `embedded`
  - `cli-bridge`
  - `local-service`
  - `feature`
  - `settings`
  - `diagnostic`
  - `capability`
  - `request`
  - `response`
- Verified that `PLANS.md`, `IMPLEMENT.md`, and `DOCUMENTATION.md` were updated.
- Verified that changed paths stayed inside the P06 allowlist.

### Regressions Avoided

- No executable code, build scripts, CI, host-specific implementation files, or packaging manifests were added.
- The architecture does not pretend that any shared-core or adapter implementation already exists.
- The docs reuse the existing governance, support, and capability model instead of redefining them.

### Remaining Issues

- Concrete serialization format details, service lifecycle details, and per-feature manifests remain for later implementation prompts.
- No runtime validation or eval integration exists yet because this prompt was architecture-only.
