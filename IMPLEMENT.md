# AIDE Implementation Log

## Purpose

`IMPLEMENT.md` is the engineering execution log for repository changes. It records what changed, why it changed, how it was verified, which risks were avoided, and what remains unresolved. It is not a changelog.

## What To Record

- the work item or prompt id
- the changed paths
- the rationale for the change
- notable design decisions and policy choices
- tradeoffs accepted
- verification that was run
- regressions or scope errors explicitly avoided
- remaining issues, blockers, or deliberate deferrals

## Current Execution Log

## Work Item: P00

### Status

Completed

### Changed Paths

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `PLANS.md`
- `IMPLEMENT.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `governance/vision.md`
- `governance/support-policy.md`
- `governance/naming-policy.md`
- `governance/capability-levels.md`
- `governance/release-policy.md`

### Rationale

Replace the bootstrap placeholders with durable repository law for AIDE before any product features, host adapters, or scaffolding are introduced.

### Notable Design Decisions

- Defined AIDE as one project with one shared core and many host adapters.
- Centralized support posture in support tiers `T0` through `T5`.
- Centralized integration depth in capability levels `L0` through `L4`.
- Separated directory naming law from exact version coverage rules.
- Kept the phase release-gated so implementation work follows governance, inventory, and harness setup.

### Tradeoffs

- The documents favor durable policy over exhaustive examples.
- Future inventory and matrix details are referenced but intentionally not created in this prompt.

### Verification

- Verified file existence for all required deliverables:
  - `README.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `PLANS.md`
  - `IMPLEMENT.md`
  - `DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - `governance/vision.md`
  - `governance/support-policy.md`
  - `governance/naming-policy.md`
  - `governance/capability-levels.md`
  - `governance/release-policy.md`
- Ran `rg` checks across the deliverables for required conceptual anchors:
  - `AIDE`
  - `Automated Integrated Development Environment`
  - `one shared core`
  - `many host adapters`
  - `compatibility technology`
  - `version ranges`
  - `support tiers`
  - `capability levels`
  - `T0`
  - `T5`
  - `L0`
  - `L4`
- Verified the repository worktree shape with `git status --short`.

### Regressions Avoided

- No product code, adapter code, CI, packaging, or environment systems were introduced prematurely.
- No exact host version lists were embedded into source directory doctrine.
- No unsupported parity claims were added.

### Remaining Issues

None for P00. Product implementation, inventory, scaffolding, harness, environments, evals, and packaging remain intentionally deferred to later prompts.
